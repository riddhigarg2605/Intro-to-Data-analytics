 Use any software tool of your choice .  
 Write down your code block,the results obtained by the code block and your analysis/inference
 
 1.Find the car with the best mpg, worst mpg.  
 
 2.Find the car with the worsthorsepower, best qsec.   
 
 3.Find 5 number summary and drawthe boxplot of displacement.  
 
 4.Draw a histogram for MPG and comment on the distribution.   
 
 5.What is average MPGfor manual vs. automatic cars?  
 
 6.Draw a side by side box plot of fuel efficiency(MPG) fortransmission (manual vs. automatic)cars. Analyzeandwrite aboutfuel efficiency in each group
 (manual vs.   automatic).  
 
 7.What is the correlation between the weight of the car and MPG? Draw a scatter plot. What is the relationship between the two attributes?  
 
 8.Draw a side by side box plot of fuel efficiency for number of gears. Analyzeandwrite aboutfuel efficiency and number of gears.   
 
 9.Create a crosstab displaying horse power and number of cylinders and explain the relationship between the two attributes.  
 
 10.Draw a scatter plot to understand the relationship between displacement and gross horse power. Use the correlation coefficientand infer the relationship.
